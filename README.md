#Sentiment Analysis-Based Election Prediction System 
The Sentiment Analysis-Based Election Prediction System is a web-based application aimed at improving election forecasting through social media analysis. 
Often, individual comments on social media are overlooked and not utilized for analytical purposes. Given that election outcomes significantly impact organizations and nations, 
this project seeks to provide precise and effective election predictions by analyzing anonymous comments, CSV data files, and social media data collected via the X API.
